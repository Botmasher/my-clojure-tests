# Clojure test drives

My notes and sample code as I try to understand Clojure's take on functional programming

## Description

I'm a never-Lisper who's playing with Clojure after a boss, mentor, colleague, friend recommended the language and the community multiple times. I've messed with it off and on, mostly off, for a couple years. I'm keeping my notes and example code here as I read helpful documentation and program along.

## Sources

So far, I've accessed these sites to learn, ordered by my use from earliest to latest:
- TryClojure (I can't find a working URI anymore)
- https://clojure.org/guides/learn/syntax
- https://kimh.github.io/clojure-by-example/
